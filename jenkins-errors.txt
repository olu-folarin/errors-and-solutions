1. Error Meessgae: 
- Failed to connect to repository : Command "git ls-remote -h -- git@github.com:olu-folarin/errors-and-solutions.git HEAD" returned status code 128:
stdout:
stderr: No ECDSA host key is known for github.com and you have requested strict checking.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.

Solution:

2. Error Message:
 - /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-11.0.18.0.10-1.amzn2.0.1.x86_64 doesnâ€™t look like a JDK directory

Likely Cause:
 - you probably didn't install the java devel package that will generate the javac version needed for jenkins to accept the provided path as a recognisable one.

Solution:
- run: yum reinstall java-11-openjdk-devel
- to confirm installation, run: rpm -q1 java-11-openjdk-devel | grep bin/javack
- restart jenkins by running: systemctl restart jenkins
